The box model is the browser's way of displaying content on the user's device. It does this by representing each element as a rectangular box containing the content, padding, border, and margin.

**Display**

- Everything in CSS has a display property whether it is explicitly set or not.
- Ex. every div is block by default and every span is inline by default

**Code**

<p>Hello</p>
<p>there</p>

<p style="display: inline;">Hello</p>
<p>there</p>
