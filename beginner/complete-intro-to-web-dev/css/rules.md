# CSS Rule

This section covers CSS rules and how to use them.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

CSS makes web pages look asthetically pleasing. As HTML is meant for the structure of the page, CSS decorates the content and the browser applies the correct styling to each element based on the selectors we write.

## Definition

The basic building block of CSS is the rule. A rule is the set of instructions that tells the browser how an HTML element should look

## Mental Model



## Syntax/Structure
```css
selector {
    property: value;
    /* Each instruction must end with a semicolon */
    proptery: value;
}
/* Selector → what you are styling (h1, button, #header)*/
/* Property → what do you want to change (color, font-size)*/
/* Value → the setting you want on the property (red, 1rem)*/
```

## When to Use
Anytime you want to change the look of the HTML you should use CSS rules. This could be for layout, responsiveness, or even interactive states.

## Interview Explanation
Think of a CSS rule as a recipe for styling an element. You tell it what ingredients (properties) to use and how to mix them (values).
